      Otters are charming, highly social mammals known for their playful
      behavior and exceptional adaptability to aquatic environments. Found in
      both freshwater and marine habitats, these creatures are skilled swimmers,
      with some species using tools, like rocks, to crack open shellfish. They
      are renowned for their dense fur, which keeps them warm in cold waters, as
      they lack a thick layer of blubber. Otters primarily feed on fish, crabs,
      and mollusks, playing an important role in maintaining the balance of
      ecosystems, such as controlling sea urchin populations to protect kelp
      forests. While they are often seen in groups, otters are also known to
      float in “rafts” in the case of sea otters, where they may hold hands to
      stay together.
